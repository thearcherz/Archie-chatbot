"Once upon a time there were three friends named Ali, Hamza and Sara. They were very close friends. They lived in a backward area called Palawan . But they were very happy with their lives. Everyday they used to play in the street from 6 o‚Äôclock to 7 o‚Äôclock <br/>In Palawan near their house was a giant house which was named as Temple of death‚Äù by the people. Because for long no body lived in their but each night came the voices of laughter and talks which horrified the people of Palawan and people thought it was the voice of ghosts so nobody dared to go in. One day while the three of them were playing in the street their ball went in to that house. Ali said come and fetch the ball and play again but Sania was much scared so she said I won‚Äôt go.<br/>But afterwards she accepted to go with them . Ali saw his father coming so he said we will go in at night. At night the three of them were out at the back of the house, they used the ladder to climb in, they were searching for their ball then they heard those voices.  Sania was scared and she fainted. Ali and Hamza went to search the balcony where they saw a light on and cries of a young boy. While they were searching Hamza slipped his feet and fell on the stairs he could clearly see some kidnappers with a boy.<br/>In the mean time Ali said Hamza I got the ball‚Äù.Hamza said `look down`<br/>Than Ali and Hamza both carried Sania out of the house. In morning Ali‚Äôs uncle who was a police man, visited their house. Ali told him about the house. His uncle raided the house and caught the kidnappers .<br/>Ali was rewarded by his uncle and now the three of them play in that house. The house is no more haunted.",
"He looked around, surrounded by his friend as they enjoyed the view. Today was a good day, he could feel it. The day he‚Äôd been waiting for, pushing for. He‚Äôd just have to wiggle a bit more and it would be his turn, his turn to explore the beautiful world that had laid before him since he was born.<br/>He looked at his friends, some were larger, some were smaller but it didn‚Äôt matter. They would explore the world together! Even Larry at the end who‚Äôd looked a bit sick lately. He readied his voice and gave the command and they began pushing and shoving.<br/>Before they knew it, it had happened. They were free, the adventure had begun and they were now rushing towards new and unknown territories. Places they had only seen from afar, creatures they‚Äôd only heard fairytales of and a new home amongst new and exciting friends.<br/>The landing had been quite rough but they had managed. Larry had gotten separated from them but not to worry, he would probably catch up later once he‚Äôd recovered. Their next journey began and if he had to say it, it hadn‚Äôt been as luxurious and exciting as people had been telling the stories, not yet anyway.<br/>It had been a rough couple of days but it could only go up from here. Larry hadn‚Äôt come back yet but he could still make it although their room had been quite small it hadn‚Äôt seemed like they had moved a lot. Next time he was definitely upgrading their tickets, they had been stuck between at least a thousand other passengers and he was happy he‚Äôd been in the middle. He couldn‚Äôt imagine the guys on the sides, they must‚Äôve been crushed.<br/>The next time he woke they had apparently arrived because they were all sitting on a balcony. The view was kind of horrible, and the sun wasn‚Äôt nearly as warm as it used to be. Now that he looked more closely there also seemed to quite a lot of them, he‚Äôd only ever seen one at home. All of that was quickly forgotten when he saw the creatures walked past him. One of them was moving straight towards them. They seemed a lot larger. A lot larger! It picked them up and dropped them.<br>It seemed a bit rough but at least, they had been the only travelers this time. He‚Äôd have to talk to the agency when he figured out who they were. Now they were sat in what appeared to be a see-through barrier. This place also had multiple suns but these were warmer than the former place.<br/>Another one of the creatures moved towards them, much smaller than the others but it seemed to be very interested in them. It hovered over them for a bit before one of its claws moved towards him. It grabbed a hold of him and before he knew it, it ripped him from the others. He looked down at his friends as he moved towards the little creature.<br/>As the boy took a bite of the banana, his mother looked at him. <br/>‚ÄúOh Jonathan, we‚Äôre having dinner in less than an hour. You won‚Äôt be able to eat anything!‚Äù and they both laughed as he threw the rest of it out.",

"A man and a young teenage boy checked into a hotel and were shown to their room. The receptionist noted the quiet manner of the guests and the pale appearance of the boy. Later, the man and boy ate dinner in the hotel restaurant. <br/>The staff again noticed that the two guests were very quiet and that the boy seemed disinterested in his food. <br/>After eating, the boy went to his room and the man went to ask the receptionist to see the manager. The receptionist initially asked if there was a problem with the service or the room, and offered to fix things, but the man said that there was no problem of the sort and repeated his request. <br/>When the manager appeared, he took him aside and explained that he was spending the night in the hotel with his fourteen-year-old son, who was seriously ill, probably terminally so. The boy was very soon to undergo therapy, which would cause him to lose his hair. They had come to the hotel to have a break together and also because the boy planned to shave his head, that night, rather than feel that the illness was beating him. The father said that he would be shaving his own head too, in support of his son. <br/>He asked that staff be respectful when the two of them came to breakfast with their shaved heads.<br/>The manager assured the father that he would inform all staff and that they would behave appropriately. <br/>The following morning the father and son entered the restaurant for breakfast. There they saw the four male restaurant staff attending to their duties, perfectly normally, all with shaved heads.<br/>No matter what business you are in, you can help people and you can make a difference.

"The Mehta family was lounging around in the living room one evening, when suddenly Dadaji asked Rohan, ‚ÄúWhat would you like for your birthday?‚ÄùRohan, who was listlessly lolling around, trying to read a book, perked up.‚ÄúA watch! A watch!‚Äù He cried excitedly. ‚ÄúI have been wanting a watch for the longest time!‚ÄùRohan was turning twelve next Sunday and he knew that whatever presents his parents gave him were always useful ones. Last year, they had bought him two pairs of shoes as he had outgrown his old shoes. Who gives shoes as a birthday present?! This year too, would be no different‚Ä¶it would either be new jeans or a new school bag. UGH! Of course, he could never express his thoughts in front of his parents.Dadaji was his only hope.The days crawled by and finally, Sunday morning heralded its arrival with the ring of the telephone. It was Rohan‚Äôs uncle calling from some remote area in Nagaland.‚ÄúHey Rohan! Happy Birthday, my young hero! What is the plan for today?‚Äù Rohan‚Äôs uncle was an officer in the Indian Army and Rohan was his favourite nephew.‚ÄúDadaji has promised to get me a watch so that is going to be the most exciting part of the day,‚Äù Rohan confided to his uncle.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great! Do send me a picture,‚Äù replied his Uncle. They chatted some more and Rohan told him about the party that was planned for that evening. Rohan‚Äôs uncle knew most of Rohan‚Äôs friends. After saying bye, Rohan handed over the phone to his mother and ran off to have a bath.At the breakfast table, Rohan wolfed down his breakfast as Dadaji watched him from across the table, with a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eyes. There was a gift wrapped box lying next to him. Rohan couldn‚Äôt take his eyes off  it. It was small enough to have a watch inside it. Rohan could barely eat his breakfast, but with his mother‚Äôs eagle eyes watching him, he had no choice!Breakfast over, Dadaji beckoned him to come closer. He then handed over the box to Rohan.Rohan could barely conceal his excitement. He hugged Dadaji and smothered his face with kisses. Dadaji laughed.Inside the box was the most perfect watch Rohan had ever laid his eyes on. It had a round, navy blue dial with a red and blue striped strap. Rohan gazed at it in wonder.The best birthday gift everSuddenly, he jumped. What was that? The watch winked at him! Was he dreaming? He looked down at the watch again. It seemed to be smiling at him!‚ÄúDadaji! This is the best present, ever!‚Äù cried aRohan.As the day passed, Rohan noticed something strange. When he was happy, the watch seemed to smile and wink, but if he was sad or even a little upset about anything, the watch would begin to look dull and sad.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost as if it can read my thoughts,‚Äù thought Rohan to himself. ‚ÄúAlmost like my twin!‚ÄùSoon they were having secret conversations‚Ä¶Rohan would look down at his watch and the watch, reading  Rohan‚Äôs mind would wink and smile or frown and look grumpy!As the days passed, Rohan realised that his watch was turning into his dearest friend.<br/¬±>‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äô asked Rohan‚Äôs mother one evening.<br>Rohan looked up. ‚Äù‚ÄùNothing,‚Äù he replied.‚ÄúThen why are you grinning goofily at your wrist watch?‚Äù she asked, sounding a little irritated. ‚ÄúYou have been acting very strange ever since you got your watch. Do you really need to check the time ever so often?‚Äù<br/>‚ÄúSorry, Mummy,‚Äù said Rohan at once. He really must be careful. Nobody would ever believe him if he told them about the strange things his watch did. He could almost imagine the shocked look on the faces of his friends and relatives if he confided in them.<br/>‚ÄúA smiling, winking watch which changes its moods according to yours? Have you gone mad?‚Äù they would snigger.<br/>Knowing his parents, they might just march him off to the nearest doctor. And even his grandfather, who was his closest friend and confidante, would wonder what had gone wrong with his grandson. He would become the laughing stock in school. He had better be careful!<br/>Rohan soon realised that he was beginning to depend a lot on his new best friend ‚Äì his wrist watch. In class, whenever he would start writing any answers he would glance quickly at the watch. If the watch smiled and winked, he knew he was correct. On the other hand, if the watch began to look dull and grumpy, Rohan knew at once that he was going off track and he needed to pull up his socks. This strange connection with his new watch actually helped him and he found himself studying harder just to see his watch smile.<br/>Rohan, who was an average student, suddenly began topping his class. His classmates noticed the refreshing change in Rohan. He came to school each morning with a spring in his step. He was confident and friendly, a far cry from the old Rohan. His teachers began to appreciate his participation in class activities.<br/>The best birthday gift ever‚ÄúWhat had changed?‚Äù they wondered collectively. The only new thing that everyone noticed about Rohan was the shiny wristwatch he wore on his left wrist. Of course, his other classmates too had wrist watches, but somehow, this one was different. But nobody could figure out how or why.<br/>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs superstitious,‚Äù was the unanimous decision in class. ‚ÄúHe likes to look at his watch before giving any answers.‚Äù<br/>The teachers, who earlier would scold Rohan for looking at his watch time and again also believed the superstition theory and soon began to overlook his quirky behaviour.<br/>At home, Rohan was careful not to look at his watch when his parents were around. Dadaji of course felt that Rohan was completely obsessed by his birthday gift! Little did he know that Rohan and his watch would be having secret conversations all the time!<br/>Nobody knew how this turnaround took place. Only Rohan knew the secret and now you do, too!"
